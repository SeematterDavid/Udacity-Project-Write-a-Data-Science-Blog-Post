## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

No particularly requisite libraries to run the code beyond the routine Anaconda distribution of Python. Python versions 3.* should work without any issues.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

As part of Udacity Nanodegree project, I have decided to use StackOverflow 2017 survey results dataset. 

As part of analysing the Stack Overflow 2017 Survey Data I would want to focus on an interesting aspect of the business of Stack Overflow site - 
What are the different aspects and parameters which impact the satisfaction of the users of this site? This will help the business take decisions about how they can improve the loyalty, increase user base and improve ad revenue. 

Key Questions I would focus upon - 
1. How does StackOverflow Satisfaction levels vary with employment status? Is there an affinity of a particular employment status group? 
2. How does StackOverflow Satisfaction levels vary with activity level on stack overflow?
3. How is the perception of Ads relevance/ disturbance impact the user satisfaction level?
4. Which are the couple of highest impact parameters impacting user satisfaction among all?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

'survey_results_public.csv' contains StackOverflow 2017 survey results 
'Write a Data Science Blog Post.ipynb' notebook showcsaes the overall work and the flow to derive answers for the 4 business Questions I  am focussing upon.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The key conclusions of the analysis are available at the [post](https://medium.com/@manishbadwe_34658/what-makes-a-tech-site-click-2ed197f30cfe) available
